    "Galleries, libraries, archives and museum collections hold valuable insights into the past. Yet for writing historical accounts, one is still dependent on accessing each institution separately. What if we could explore the past by searching through all these institutional collections at the same time? This would not only simplify the work of historians and researchers in general, it could also allow asking more complex questions. To be able to integrate information across different institutions, this data needs to be shared and connected on the Web, while still being searchable by machines to index and retrieve information. Here, the Semantic Web offers essential solutions.  \n",

    "The general vision behind the Semantic Web is to make the Web more accessible to computers. While humans are able to read texts, the computer needs machine readable data that is structured and interlinked. Although that data in itself is nothing more than bits and bytes of information, when it is analyzed an interpreted it can give valuable information, new insights and it can support humans taking informed decissions.  \n",

Like this the Web is growing on an estonishing scale and every person with a computer or smart phone can access this information. We are living in the greatest information revolution, never before did people have access to these amounts of information. This same weblike nature is also part of the Semantic Web, every party can independently publish datasets on the Web, another party can annotate, create links between datasets or analyse and use it. The full Semantic Web vision is still not materialized, but many are contributing, including galleries, museums, libraries and archives.  \n",

    "For understanding the basic principles of the semantic web, it is good to unravel the layered approach that was taken to build it. The first essential step is to make (semi-)structured data available on the Web. Currently, the predominant language on the Web is HTML. Although that most web pages are still written in HTML, machines will encounter problems while reading this web content. For example: \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Rembrandt van Rijn \n",
    " Self-portrait \n",
    " c. 1628 \n",
    " oil on panel \n",
    "height 22.6 cm × width 18.7 cm \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "While humans are able to understand that this information is about an artwork, a keyword-based search engine will not be able to identify the title of the artwork or the year in which it was made. For the semantic Web approach, it is important to format this information in another way: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "<artist> Rembrandt van Rijn <artist> \n",
    " <title> Self-portrait <title> \n",
    " <year> c. 1628 <year> \n",
    " <medium> oil on panel <medium> \n",
    " < height > 22.6 cm < height > × < width > 18.7 cm < width > \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Now the computer is able to distinguish the artist, the title and the year of this artwork. This representation is more easily processable by machines and also known as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technology. In contrast to HTML, XML language allows structuring information on web pages. Yet structuring information is not enough to make the Web semantic, therefore we also need a language that it able to describe meaning.  \n",

    "The RDF data model \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "How can the meaning then be described, in an accurate way so that machines are able to process this? To  capture the intended semantics of the data, it is essential to have a knowledge representation system and ontologies. The philosophical discipline of ontology is the study of what exists and what are the relationships between the entities that exist. Classifying entities and discerning part-whole relations gives us a systematic way to organize knowledge and grasp the reality surrounding us. The Linnaean taxonomy, for example, as proposed in the Systema Naturae (1735) tried to sytematically organize the natural world into kingdoms (the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms), classes, orders, genera and eventually this classified the individual species. Such a classification systems increases our understanding of singular entities, such as ‘a cat is a mammal’, ‘Covid is a virus disease’, and ‘violet red is a color’. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Web to be semantic, it needs ontologies to provide a shared understanding of a domain. Over time better organized taxonomies were created and especially in our age of information explosion more complex and flexible classifications are reached. The ontologies used for the Web are non-hierarchical, it aims to represent the fluidity of the real world, where things can be related to each other in more complex ways and without being fixed. Things can endlessly be grouped in new ways, in that sense the structure of a Linked Data ontology is more like a spider’s web. \n",

    "On the semantic Web, the RDF data model is used as a knowledge representation. The fundamental concepts of RDF are resources, properties, statements and graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Resources \n",
    "\n",
    "Resources can be many things, from people to places, from plants to machines, everything can be a resource. On the semantic Web, each resource has a URI (Uniform Resource Locator, or web address) that allows an unambigous identification of that particular ‘thing’.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we are searching for a particular person, let’s say Jack Straw. The unique identifier given to that person is a number comparible with a telephone number, it is a specific number through which you can find that person. However, Jack Straw is both the name of a fourteenth-century English rebel and a UK cabinet minister prominent in Tony Blair’s administration. It is clearly useful to be able to differentiate the two people who share a common name, so each person is represented by a unique number, let’s make the UK minister Jack Straw number 64183282, and Jack Straw described as ‘the enigmatic rebel leader’ number 33059614. Providing that everyone uses these two numbers to refer to the respective Jack Straws, we can now search for person 64183282 in a linked open dataset and can be confident that we are getting the right person - in this case, the minister. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Jack Straw the modern politician was a member of British Parliament, representing the seat of Blackburn. There’s more than one place in the UK called Blackburn, not to mention other Blackburns around the world. Using the same principles as outlined above, we can disambiguate between the various Blackburns by assigning a unique identifier to the correct place: Blackburn in Lancashire, England. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "At first sights, this may look simular as a library system, but there is an essential difference. Around the world there are many libraries, each with their own database and each giving their own numbers to for example the person ‘Jack Straw’. So the number ‘330596140’ in a library system does no longer identify unique individuals outside of that particular database. In contrast, URI references are designed to be unique across the Web. \n",

    "  \n",
    "Therefore, URI’s are recorded in so-called authority files, such as the VIAF authority file. In the video above, the VIAF ID number ‘33059614’ is used as a search term to find Jack Straw in various libraries around the world. While all describe this person slightly different, they all mean the same person. Under the VIAF ID, there is a permalink, that’s the URI. HTTP URIs make it possible for people (as well as machines) to find concepts and idnetify that all these “Jack Straws” are the same person.  \n",

    "Properties \n",

    "Properties are a specific type of resource that is describing the relationships between the other resources, for example “painted by”, “located in”, “collected by”, etc. Like all resources, also properties are identified by URI’s. Properties are essential for building relationships between two data elements, this expression we call a statement.  \n",

    "Simply put, LOD is structured information in a format meant for machines. Therefore, it is not necessarily easy on the eye. Once you understand the principles, you can get a machine to do the actual reading for you.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of linked data is to publish structured data in a way that is interlinked and processable by machines. It allows to share and connect data from different data repositories. Therefore, it makes it possible to formulate more complex questions, resulting in answers that other search engines on the Internet would not be able to retrieve. One of the applications of LOD is the creation of improved search engines, and therefore the improvement of information retrieval on the Web. If you are curious about this you can try it yourself at Wolfram Alpha.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about the fields of academia and cultural heritage, LOD allows for institutions to make all of their data available online, making it possible for those with access to it to re-use it for new research, building on the existing one. In recent years, many institutions have realized the potential of LOD, and have started to make data in their possession both open and linked to other data online. These institutions are making it possible to link, cross-reference, aggregate data, and it facilitates extensive research. Another application of LOD is the improvement of information retrieval for heritage collections. If you are curious about this you can check out these resources: the British Museum’s Research Space and the Yale Centre for British Art Online.  \n",

    "Filled with data: semantic web.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Computers cannot read what is in the documents because the documents are in the containers! \n",
    "\n",
    "If all datasets were openly published, and used the same format for structuring information, it would be possible to interrogate all of the datasets at once. Analysing huge volumes of data is potentially much more powerful than everyone using their own individual datasets dotted around the web in what are known as information silos. These interoperable datasets are what LOD practitioners are working towards. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand LOD, it is necessary to first go back in time. It was 1989, and Tim Berners-Lee was in his office at CERN. After working tirelessly for weeks, he had finally come up with a non-linear interactive system, for connecting documents on a network through hyperlinks. He had thus created the World Wide Web.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tim Berners-Lee coined the term for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machines - that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. The term “Semantic Web” refers to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Semantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Semantic Web is an extension to the World Wide Web that adds new data and metadata to existing Web documents, extending those documents into data. Extending Web documents to data is what will enable the Web to be processed automatically by machines and also manually by humans.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Linked Open Data (LOD) aims at solving these problems. LOD is a set of standards that allow us to make collections of data available via the web. It allows us to share machine-readable open data. When organizations decide to do so, they contribute to the LOD Cloud, the whole of “datasets that have been published [on the Internet] in the Linked Data format.” The goal is to publish open databases on the web in a way that they can be queried at once. LOD is the implementation of ‘I’ in FAIR data; it makes data Interoperable.   \n",
