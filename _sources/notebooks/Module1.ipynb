This would not only simplify the work of historians and researchers in general, it could also allow asking more complex questions. To be able to integrate information across different institutions, this data needs to be shared and connected on the Web, while still being searchable by machines to index and retrieve information.

    "While humans are able to understand that this information is about an artwork, a keyword-based search engine will not be able to identify the title of the artwork or the year in which it was made. For the semantic Web approach, it is important to format this information in another way: \n",

    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "Now the computer is able to distinguish the artist, the title and the year of this artwork. This representation is more easily processable by machines and also known as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technology. In contrast to HTML, XML language allows structuring information on web pages. Yet structuring information is not enough to make the Web semantic, therefore we also need a language that it able to describe meaning.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## The RDF data model \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "How can the meaning then be described, in an accurate way so that machines are able to process this? To  capture the intended semantics of the data, it is essential to have a knowledge representation system and ontologies. The philosophical discipline of ontology is the study of what exists and what are the relationships between the entities that exist. Classifying entities and discerning part-whole relations gives us a systematic way to organize knowledge and grasp the reality surrounding us. The Linnaean taxonomy, for example, as proposed in the Systema Naturae (1735) tried to sytematically organize the natural world into kingdoms (the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral Kingdoms), classes, orders, genera and eventually this classified the individual species. Such a classification systems increases our understanding of singular entities, such as ‘a cat is a mammal’, ‘Covid is a virus disease’, and ‘violet red is a color’. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Web to be semantic, it needs ontologies to provide a shared understanding of a domain. Over time better organized taxonomies were created and especially in our age of information explosion more complex and flexible classifications are reached. The ontologies used for the Web are non-hierarchical, it aims to represent the fluidity of the real world, where things can be related to each other in more complex ways and without being fixed. Things can endlessly be grouped in new ways, in that sense the structure of a Linked Data ontology is more like a spider’s web. \n",

    "On the semantic Web, the RDF data model is used as a knowledge representation. The fundamental concepts of RDF are resources, properties, statements and graphs. \n",

    "## Resources \n",
    "\n",
    "Resources can be many things, from people to places, from plants to machines, everything can be a resource. On the semantic Web, each resource has a URI (Uniform Resource Locator, or web address) that allows an unambigous identification of that particular ‘thing’.  \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "For instance, we are searching for a particular person, let’s say Jack Straw. The unique identifier given to that person is a number comparible with a telephone number, it is a specific number through which you can find that person. However, Jack Straw is both the name of a fourteenth-century English rebel and a UK cabinet minister prominent in Tony Blair’s administration. It is clearly useful to be able to differentiate the two people who share a common name, so each person is represented by a unique number, let’s make the UK minister Jack Straw number 64183282, and Jack Straw described as ‘the enigmatic rebel leader’ number 33059614. Providing that everyone uses these two numbers to refer to the respective Jack Straws, we can now search for person 64183282 in a linked open dataset and can be confident that we are getting the right person - in this case, the minister. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Jack Straw the modern politician was a member of British Parliament, representing the seat of Blackburn. There’s more than one place in the UK called Blackburn, not to mention other Blackburns around the world. Using the same principles as outlined above, we can disambiguate between the various Blackburns by assigning a unique identifier to the correct place: Blackburn in Lancashire, England. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first sights, this may look simular as a library system, but there is an essential difference. Around the world there are many libraries, each with their own database and each giving their own numbers to for example the person ‘Jack Straw’. So the number ‘330596140’ in a library system does no longer identify unique individuals outside of that particular database. In contrast, URI references are designed to be unique across the Web. "
