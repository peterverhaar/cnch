    "## Publishing Linked Open data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that are made available by cultural heritage institutions can be very heterogenous. Institutions may use a wide variety of formats, including relational databases, CSV, XML documents or JSON. If the data is in one of these formats, it can be useful to convert these data sets into RDF first. When the data is available as Linked Data, it eventually becomes much easier to reuse the data and to integrate the data into other data collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a given data set into the RDF format, we can follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Create a conceptual model of the original data set.***\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, make a clear and comprehensive list of all the entities and the properties of these entities that are described. You may describe this model in a simple text file, in which you enumerate these various properties. If you work with a single CSV file, listing all the column names specified in the header of the CSV file is usually sufficient. In the case of more complex databases, you may also make use of a more formal notation technique, such as an Entity Relationship Diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Find appropriate URIs for all the entities and the properties in the model.***\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use URIs in the following vocabularies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schema.org\n",
    "- DCterms\n",
    "- FOAF\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Produce a system for assigning unique identifiers for the individual items that are described in your dataset.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "If your CSV has row numbers, for example, you may choose to work with these row numbers as identifiers for the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Transform the dataset***\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these three preparatory steps, you can begin to transform the dataset. The procedure is essentially that each value in the original data set (e.g. a single cell in a spreadsheet) will become a separate triple. The identifier that you have assigned to the row (according to step 3) should become the subject. The URI of the property you associated with the column this value is in should be used as a predicate. The value itself will become an object. This value may be either a literal or a URI. The conversion can be carried out using tools such as COW or LDWizard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "This general process will be demonstrated using a very simple CSV file, consisting of four rows only.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Planning the data conversion***\n",

    "\n",
    "As explained above, it is necessary first to describe the underlying structure or the conceptual model of the data. In this example, such a description can be produced easily, as the lists of properties can be copied directly to the header of the CSV file.\n",

    "Once you have developed a sufficiently clear understanding of the model, you can begin to link the various properties that you have identified to URI. During this specific search, you can make use of Linked Open Vocabularies website. On this site, you can type in a property in the search bar at the top. This online application will then attempt to find matching terms. Using this website, we can find the following URIs for the colum names in our sample data set."
